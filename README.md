## License

In order to help ensure fairness and sharing, some open source R.SK Lab software
(the Software) is dual-licensed. Be aware that all usage, unless otherwise specified,
is under the **RPL-1.5** license.

- Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL-1.5): https://opensource.org/licenses/RPL-1.5

You should read the entire license; especially the PREAMBLE at the
beginning. In short, the word **reciprocal** means "giving something back in
return for what you are getting". It is not a freeware license. This
license requires that you open-source all source code for any
project which uses the Software. Creating and maintaining the Software is hard work.
That's why there is one simple requirement for you: Give something back 
to the world. Whether that's code or financial support for the Software is entirely
up to you, but nothing else grants you any right to use the Software.

Furthermore, the Software is also available to certain entities under a
modified version of the RPL-1.5, which has been modified to allow users to use the
Software without open-sourcing the projects. The modified license
(see [LICENSE_RSK_LAB_PROFESSIONAL](./LICENSE_RSK_LAB_PROFESSIONAL.txt))
is granted to certain entities, at R.SK Lab's discretion, and for a limited period
of time (unless otherwise agreed), pursuant to R.SK Lab's terms. Currently, R.SK Lab is
granting this license to all [professional subscribers](./SUBSCRIPTIONS.md) for
the duration of their subscriptions. You can become a professional subscriber by
either contributing substantial amounts of high-quality code, or by subscribing
for a fee. This licensing ensures fairness and stimulates the continued growth
of open source R.SK Lab software through both code contributions and the financial
support it needs.

You are not required to accept this License since you have not signed it,
however nothing else grants you permission to use, copy, distribute, modify,
or create derivatives of either the Software or any Extensions
created by a Contributor. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by performing any of these actions You indicate
Your acceptance of this License and Your agreement to be bound by all its terms
and conditions. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
LICENSE DO NOT USE, MODIFY, CREATE DERIVATIVES, OR DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE. IF
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO COMPLY WITH ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
LICENSE THEN YOU CAN NOT USE, MODIFY, CREATE DERIVATIVES, OR DISTRIBUTE THE
SOFTWARE.
